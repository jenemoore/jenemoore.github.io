# Finishing 3d Prints

## Tools

- utility knife--size 11 blade
- dremel
- sanding
	- cardboard nail files work well
	- increase your grit: 400 up to 4000
	- wet sanding for a polished finish
- heat smoothing: heat gun, not hairdryer
- primer: easier than sanding and a nicer finish, but you will need several coats, drying time, and finishing paint
- epoxy coat: mix it up, paint it on evenly
