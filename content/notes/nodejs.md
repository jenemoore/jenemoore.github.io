# Learning Node

(I hate it but maybe that's because I don't know it very well)

https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node/#the-art-of-node
https://nodeschool.io/ -- probably the best starter

Roadmap.sh:
    Backend roadmap up to language selection
    then the Javascript roadmap (probably not bad for review)

    ...huh. I'm 3/4 of the way through their devops list without even really trying?
