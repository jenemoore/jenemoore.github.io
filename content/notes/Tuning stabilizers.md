00 or 000 paintbrushes; krytox (dielectric grease for the wires if you want to)

1. disassemble stabs: pull out the wires and separate all parts (housing, wire, stem)
2. if the bottom of your stem isn't flat, clip off the "fangs" so it sits flush
3. lube the housings: a dab on the inside on the two largest sides, then the back edge, then coat; you want just enough for a slight sheen/cloudiness
4. re-insert the stems: the side with two holes goes to the open edge
5. lube the wires: cushion the wire inside the housing with a thickish lubricant - you want an even layer you can barely see the wire through, from the end of the wire up just past the bend
6. Re-insert the wire into the topmost hole of the stem before lubing the other end and reassembling
7. test your stabs WITH KEYS before soldering - listen for rattle, test for sluggish feel
	1. if it needs more lube, you can use a syringe to pump more into the housing through the hole in the back of the stem
	2. if it has too much lube, you're going to have to disassemble and clean
