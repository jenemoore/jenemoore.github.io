* list all keybindings with `bind -P` 
* use an .inputrc to add keybindings 
* https://stitcher.io/blog/mastering*key*bindings
* https://knock.app/blog/how*to*design*great*keyboard*shortcuts (includes maps)
* also uses ~/Library/Keybindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
* you can rebind the modifiers in system preferences
* might be worthwhile to delete karabiner and just do it this way
* can't do macros like this (or fully remap keys) but you can do that on a keyboard
* AHA Karabiner*EventViewer will show you the keycode for mouse buttons/key presses
* Accessibility Keyboard: Dwell (hover to click)
* suggestions: 
	* set F2 F3 F4 to cut/copy/paste
	* set F11/F12 to prev/next tab
	* set a hotkey to switch to previous app
	* set a hotkey to reopen closed tabs
	* set a hotkey to close tabs?
	* use function keys for switching spaces
* time to look at adding layers to the keyboard: 
	* change caps lock to a macro key; set shift to caps lock when tapped
	* mod + number for layers? possible
	* QMK supports leader keys, don't forget
	* 
* and if I can get my keybindings set up properly then maybe I can cope with Amethyst again
